# Multi-version documentation

compodocx generates a fully self-contained, statically-served site on every run. Every URL in the output uses a relative path (`./images/favicon.ico`, `../components/Foo.html`, depth-aware Pagefind loader), so multiple builds can sit side-by-side in one parent folder under different version subdirectories with no rewrite step.

This page documents the pattern. It is purely a usage convention — there are no special CLI flags. If you can run `compodocx` once, you can run it N times into N folders.

## The pattern

Build each version into its own folder under a single deploy root:

```text
public/                  ← deploy this folder
├── index.html           ← optional landing page (your own)
├── v0.2.0/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── components/
│   ├── modules/
│   └── …
├── v0.3.0/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── components/
│   └── …
└── latest/              ← optional symlink → v0.3.0
```

You produce that layout by running compodocx once per version, each with its own `-d`:

```bash
git checkout v0.2.0
npx compodocx -p tsconfig.json -d public/v0.2.0 -n "MyLib v0.2.0"

git checkout v0.3.0
npx compodocx -p tsconfig.json -d public/v0.3.0 -n "MyLib v0.3.0"

git checkout main
ln -sfn v0.3.0 public/latest    # optional convenience pointer
```

Deploy `public/` to any static host. Each version sub-site is fully self-contained: opening `https://example.com/v0.2.0/components/Foo.html` works, and so does `https://example.com/v0.3.0/components/Foo.html`. Nothing in `v0.2.0/` references `v0.3.0/` and vice versa.

## Why it works

1. **All asset references are relative.** The generated HTML uses `./images/...`, `./styles/...`, `./js/...` from the index page and `../images/...` from one-level-deep entity pages. There is zero `href="/..."` or `src="/..."` in the output.
2. **Pagefind is depth-aware.** The search loader computes its path from `window.COMPODOC_CURRENT_PAGE_DEPTH` and resolves `pagefind/pagefind.js` relative to the current page, so search keeps working at any subdirectory depth.
3. **Each build owns its own assets.** `images/`, `styles/`, `js/`, `pagefind/`, `graph/` all live inside the per-version folder. Different versions can ship different bundled JS/CSS without colliding.

## Deployment recipes

Any static host that serves a directory tree works. The patterns below are tested on the most common ones.

### GitHub Pages

`actions/deploy-pages` uploads whatever is in `public/`. Loop your tags in the workflow, build each into `public/<tag>/`, then deploy:

```yaml
- name: Build versioned docs
  run: |
      for v in v0.2.0 v0.3.0; do
          git checkout "$v"
          npx compodocx -p tsconfig.json -d "public/$v" -n "MyLib $v" --silent
      done
      git checkout main
      cp landing/index.html public/index.html

- uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
  with:
      path: public
```

The site is served at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/v0.2.0/`, `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/v0.3.0/`, etc.

### Netlify / Vercel

Set the publish directory to `public/`. The same shell loop in your build command produces the same layout. Both providers serve subdirectory `index.html` files directly without rewrites.

### plain nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name docs.example.com;
    root /var/www/docs;       # this is your "public/" folder
    index index.html;

    # serve subdirectory index files: /v0.2.0/ → /v0.2.0/index.html
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ $uri/index.html =404;
    }
}
```

No version-specific blocks needed. Each `/v<x.y.z>/` is just a directory that nginx serves.

## A landing page

`public/index.html` is yours to write — compodocx never emits a top-level landing page when you build into a subdirectory. A minimal one that lists known versions:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>MyLib documentation</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
                max-width: 40rem;
                margin: 4rem auto;
                padding: 0 1rem;
            }
            ul {
                list-style: none;
                padding: 0;
            }
            li {
                margin: 0.5rem 0;
            }
            a {
                font-size: 1.1rem;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>MyLib</h1>
        <p>Pick a version:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="./latest/">latest</a> (currently v0.3.0)</li>
            <li><a href="./v0.3.0/">v0.3.0</a></li>
            <li><a href="./v0.2.0/">v0.2.0</a></li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

## A drop-in version switcher

If you want a version dropdown rendered on every page of the docs, the simplest path is a small inline script injected via compodocx's `--extTheme` (a CSS file can `@import` nothing, but you can lean on `--customLogo` together with the trick below). The cleanest cross-version solution today is post-processing: walk the per-version folders after every build and prepend a tiny snippet into each `<body>` tag.

```bash
# scripts/inject-version-switcher.sh — run once, after building all versions
SWITCHER='<div style="position:fixed;top:0.5rem;right:1rem;z-index:9999;font:14px system-ui">'
SWITCHER+='Version: <select onchange="if(this.value)location.href=this.value">'
SWITCHER+='<option value="">switch…</option>'
SWITCHER+='<option value="/v0.3.0/">v0.3.0</option>'
SWITCHER+='<option value="/v0.2.0/">v0.2.0</option>'
SWITCHER+='</select></div>'

for f in public/v*/index.html public/v*/components/*.html public/v*/modules/*.html; do
    [ -f "$f" ] || continue
    grep -q "switch…" "$f" && continue   # idempotent
    sed -i.bak "s|<body[^>]*>|&${SWITCHER}|" "$f" && rm -f "$f.bak"
done
```

A native version-switcher component (built into the template, picking up an external `versions.json`) is on the roadmap for a future release. Until then, post-processing or a separate landing page is the recommended approach.

## Conventions worth following

- **One subfolder per version, never mixed layouts.** Don't build `v0.2.0/` into a flat `public/` and then build `v0.3.0/` alongside it — the assets will collide.
- **A `latest/` pointer.** A symlink (or a copy on platforms without symlinks) saves users from memorising the highest published number.
- **Version names in the page title.** Pass `-n "MyLib v0.3.0"` so browser tabs and search results show which version is open.
- **Disable search if you build many versions.** Pagefind indexes are ~hundreds of KB per version. If you publish ten releases, that adds up. Pass `--disableSearch` on older versions you don't expect anyone to search.

## Limitations today

- **No in-page version switcher.** The drop-in snippet above is the workaround. A built-in switcher is on the roadmap.
- **No automatic cross-version linking.** A symbol that exists in v0.2.0 and v0.3.0 has no automatic "see this in vX" link. Each per-version site is independent.
- **Template Playground and the live `--serve` mode use absolute URLs.** Both are runtime-only conveniences, not part of the static output you deploy. They are unaffected by the multi-version layout, but they cannot themselves run from a subdirectory.
- **Per-symbol `@since` badges.** compodocx renders `@since` tags from JSDoc when authors include them in their source — it does not infer them from a multi-version diff.

## Verifying it works

A two-line smoke test against the included sample fixture:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/multi-version-smoke
node ./bin/index-cli.js -p test/fixtures/sample-files/tsconfig.simple.json \
    -d /tmp/multi-version-smoke/v0.2.0 --silent --disableSearch -n "v0.2.0"
node ./bin/index-cli.js -p test/fixtures/sample-files/tsconfig.simple.json \
    -d /tmp/multi-version-smoke/v0.3.0 --silent --disableSearch -n "v0.3.0"

npx sirv-cli /tmp/multi-version-smoke --port 4500 &
sleep 2

curl -s http://localhost:4500/v0.2.0/index.html | grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'
curl -s http://localhost:4500/v0.3.0/index.html | grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'

kill %1
```

You should see two distinct titles, one per version, both served as HTTP 200 from the same parent folder.

## Future

Items deferred past v0.3.0, with no commitment to ship:

- An in-page version switcher widget driven by a `versions.json` file at the deploy root.
- A `compodocx multi-version` convenience command that reads a tag list and runs the loop.
- Per-symbol "added in vX" / "removed in vX" badges synthesised from a multi-version snapshot diff.
- Cross-version "view this symbol in vX" links inside entity pages.

If any of these matters to your project, open an issue on the [compodocx repo](https://github.com/cngxjs/compodocx) — pattern adoption from real users is what drives prioritisation.
