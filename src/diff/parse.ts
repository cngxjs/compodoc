/**
 * Parser + schemaVersion gate for the `compodocx diff` CLI.
 *
 * Reads a `documentation.json` file from disk, validates the JSON shape, and
 * confirms the snapshot was produced by a compodocx ≥ 0.3.0 release (i.e. has
 * a numeric `schemaVersion` field). Pre-v0.3.0 outputs are unversioned —
 * those need re-exporting before the diff can run.
 *
 * The gate is intentionally strict: comparing across schema versions silently
 * produces nonsense (renamed fields show as removed-then-added, etc.), so we
 * fail fast with a clear actionable message.
