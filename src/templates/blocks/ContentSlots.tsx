/**
 * Content-slot inventory harvested from `@slot <name> <description>` JSDoc
 * tags on a component or directive.
 *
 * Answers the question a consumer has before they know a slot directive
 * exists: what can I project into this thing. The slot directives
 * themselves are marker directives with no inputs and no outputs, so
 * their own pages carry no API surface to discover this from.
 *
 * Rendered on both `ComponentPage` and `DirectivePage`. Directives host
 * slots just as often as components do - a structural host like an item
 * or a tab is frequently a directive - so gating this on the page kind
 * would hide the inventory for exactly the hosts whose own API tab is
 * emptiest.
