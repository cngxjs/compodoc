/**
 * CSS class-rename rules for `compodocx migrate css`.
 *
 * Three rule kinds:
 *  - `never-touch`  — pattern that must NEVER be rewritten (e.g. `data-compodoc`
 *                     attributes are intentionally preserved per CLAUDE.md).
 *  - `exact`        — exact-match class name → replacement.
 *  - `prefix`       — class names with this prefix get the prefix replaced.
 *
 * Order matters: never-touch wins, then exact, then prefix. Encoded as an
 * ordered array so the rewriter can short-circuit on the first match.
